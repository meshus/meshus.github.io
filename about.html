            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm Kidus Mengistu, a passionate developer with 5 years of experience. I specialize in creating responsive and user-friendly web applications using modern technologies like React, Vue, and Angular. My goal is to craft digital experiences that are not only visually appealing but also highly functional and accessible.</p>
            <p>Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work on diverse projects, from e-commerce platforms to complex data visualization tools. This variety has honed my skills in problem-solving and adapting to different project requirements.</p>
            <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new web technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or sharing my knowledge through blog posts and community meetups. I believe in continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in web development.</p>
            <p>Let's connect and create something amazing together!</p>
